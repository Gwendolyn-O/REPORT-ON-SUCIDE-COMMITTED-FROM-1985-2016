# REPORT-ON-SUCIDE-COMMITTED-FROM-1985-2016
OBSERVATION

The data provides an overview of global suicide rates from 1985 to 2016.

It was observed that the year 2002 had the highest number of reported suicide cases, with 256,079 deaths, while 1983 recorded the lowest, with 116,063 cases. By 2016, the number of reported suicide cases had significantly declined to 18,603.

Suicide was most prevalent among individuals aged 35–45 years, with a total of 2,452,141 reported cases. In contrast, the age group 5–14 years had the fewest cases, with 52,264 reported suicides.

Countries with high GDPs, such as the United States, Japan, Germany, the UK, France, and Italy, had notable suicide rates. The United States ranked first, with a GDP of $3.9 trillion annually.

The two countries with the highest reported cases of suicide deaths were the Russian Federation, with 1,209,742 cases, and the United States, with 1,034,013 cases.

The data also showed that males accounted for a significantly higher percentage of suicides (76.89%), while females made up 23.11%.

Among generational cohorts, Baby Boomers had the highest number of suicide cases, with 2,284,498 reported deaths, whereas Generation Z had the fewest, with 15,906 cases.

Among the top 10 countries with reported suicide cases, the United States led with 8,054,027,201 cases, followed by Brazil, with 4,856,093,548 reported cases.

 

RECOMMENDATION

Based on the analysis of suicide rates from 1985 to 2016, several key insights have emerged that should guide future actions in suicide prevention and mental health care:

 

Focus on High-Risk Age Groups: The data shows that individuals aged 35–45 years are most at risk. Targeted mental health interventions, support programs, and awareness campaigns should be directed toward this age group. Employers, communities, and healthcare providers should be trained to recognize warning signs and offer early interventions.

 

Increase Support for Youth: While the number of suicides among those aged 5–14 years is lower, any cases within this vulnerable age group are a cause for concern. Schools, parents, and pediatric healthcare providers should be equipped with the resources to address early signs of mental distress and provide adequate support systems for young people.

Gender-Specific Interventions: Since males represent the majority of suicide cases (76.89%), there is a need to develop gender-sensitive approaches to mental health support. Programs that focus on the unique pressures and barriers faced by men in seeking help should be prioritized, particularly in high-risk professions or communities.

 

Target High-GDP Countries for Awareness Campaigns: Countries with high GDP, such as the United States, Japan, and Germany, exhibit notable suicide rates despite economic stability. This indicates that mental health challenges transcend economic factors. National mental health initiatives in these countries should be expanded, with a focus on reducing stigma and improving access to mental health services.

 

Addressing Generational Differences: Baby Boomers reported the highest number of suicides, indicating that mental health resources may not be as accessible or acceptable to this generation. Tailored mental health campaigns for older adults, combined with accessible counseling services, should be considered. For Generation Z, although the suicide rate is lower, preventive measures should be maintained and improved to ensure that the younger population has access to mental health support early on.

 

Global Collaboration: Given the high number of suicides in countries like the Russian Federation and the United States, global cooperation on suicide prevention is critical. Sharing best practices and developing international support networks can enhance the impact of national and regional suicide prevention strategies.

Strengthen Data Collection and Monitoring: To ensure the accuracy and timeliness of suicide-related data, efforts should be made to improve global data collection and monitoring systems. This will allow for more responsive and informed decision-making on suicide prevention policies.
